# Prework Study Guide Webpage for Coding Bootcamp

## Description

The Prework Study Guide Webpage for Coding Bootcamp contains information to help students remember the basics in the prework: HTML, CSS, Git and Javascript. It can be used to help remember a command syntax, but it can also be used as a powerful study aid when preparing for the final exam.

A study guide is a useful tool if you remember a few things:

1. Start early. Take notes in the Study Guide right when you start class.
2. Enter information wisely. Use keywords and phrases, syntax and quick hints. The Study Guide should be an easy way to access knowledge.
3. Keep it up to date. Set a day on your calendar to spend 5 to 10 minutes with your Study Guide to enter new information and enhance existing notes.
